  "description" : "Mixin adds events dispatching mechanism to your class. EventHandler provides methods to bind/unbind handler of an event, to handle a specific event only once, to associate an event with a namespace what later make possible to unbind handler of event with help of namespace. EventHandler allows redirecting events to/from another instance. Unlike alternative implementation of the concept, EventHandler is strict by default and force developer to explicitly declare / bind / unbind all events supported by object. Use it to add events dispatching mechanism to your classes and avoid accumulation of technical dept and potential errors.",
